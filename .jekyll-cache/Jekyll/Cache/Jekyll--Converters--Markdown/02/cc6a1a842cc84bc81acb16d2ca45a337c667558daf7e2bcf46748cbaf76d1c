I"Í<p>I have recently started learning to code in Java, with the end-goal being getting acquainted with common Data Structures and Algorithms. While working on the really enriching <a href="https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/">Helsinki MOOC</a>, I was able to create a Dungeon game from scratch. Although itâ€™s a really simple game, I do feel really accomplished as a Java beginner to have completed this and hence am documenting it :-)</p>
